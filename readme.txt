Pokedex Game, in Progress

Instructions:  click on the spinning icons (on both sides of the screen) to see the two Trainer's pokemon play against each other.

Process:  We compared our projects and quickly decided which components would work well together.  We used Jamie's CSS and HTML as the foundation for the visuals, and we used Maiya's JavaScript as the foundation for the functionality.  We did a wire-frame and figured out what the container elements on the page would be, so that we could work separately on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but know that we would have the right connecting points.

In his original project, Jamie had focused more on CSS and understanding SASS;  while, Maiya had focused more on JavaScript and understanding promises.  As we implemented these two things into our joined project, we taught each other what our code bases were doing.

Jamie implemented all of the CSS, SASS, and HTML.  He used the color "vermillion" because we were assigned the "Vermillion Gym" and incorporated Pokemon-style branding.

Maiya implemented the JavaScript requests to the a.p.i., returning of promises, and the functionality of the stats animation.

Both Jamie and Maiya created CSS animations.  Jamie did the CSS animations for the spinning icons, the type-animation, and the pulsating glow animations, to add to the hypnotic effect of the visuals.  Maiya did the CSS animations for the rendering of the stats.  Jamie adjusted the visuals on Maiya's stats animations, to incorporate them into the design theme.

We both felt like our projects were complimentary;  and we learned a lot from each other.
