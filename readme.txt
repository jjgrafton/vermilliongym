Pokedex Game, in Progress

Instructions:  
1) click on the spinning icons (on both sides of the screen) to see the two Trainer's pokemon play against each other.
2) Also, zoom out on your browser window to adjust the sizing.


Work Process:  We compared our projects and quickly decided which components would work well together.  We used Jamie's CSS and HTML as the foundation for the visuals, and we used Maiya's JavaScript as the foundation for the functionality.  We did a wire-frame and figured out what the container elements on the page would be, so that we could work separately on HTML/CSS and JavaScript, but know that we would have the right connecting points.

In his original project, Jamie had focused more on CSS and understanding SASS;  while, Maiya had focused more on JavaScript and understanding promises.  As we implemented these two things into our joined project, we taught each other what our code bases were doing.

Jamie implemented all of the CSS, SASS (including mixins), and HTML.  He used the color "vermillion" red because we were assigned the "Vermillion Gym" and used simple clean design principles.

Maiya implemented the JavaScript requests to the a.p.i., returning of promises, and the functionality of the stats animation.

Both Jamie and Maiya created CSS animations.  Jamie did the CSS animations for the spinning icons, the type-animation, and the pulsating glow animations, to add to the hypnotic effect of the visuals.  Maiya did the CSS animations for the rendering of the stats. The animate.css library was used to get the bounce effect on the numbers. Jamie adjusted the visuals on Maiya's stats animations, to incorporate them into the design theme.

We both felt like our projects were complimentary;  and we learned a lot from each other.

We plan to keep working on the project and turn it into a functioning game.
